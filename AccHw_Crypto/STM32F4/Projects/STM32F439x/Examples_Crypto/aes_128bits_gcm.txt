@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library AES algorithm
and the different steps (Initialization/Append data/Finalization) to perform AES
128 bits Encryption/Decryption processes for GCM mode .

This example is split into two parts:
The first part is to: 
1 - Encrypt DATA in GCM mode 
2 - Generate authentication TAG
3 - Compare between the generated TAG data and expected generated TAG
4 - Compare between the encrypted data and expected encrypted data 

In case of successful Encryption operations AES algorithm routines can return
AES_SUCCESS or one of the following error codes in case of fail:

  - AES_ERR_BAD_OPERATION,
  - AES_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT,
  - AES_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER.

The second part is to:
1 - Decrypt DATA in GCM mode
2 - Check the authentication TAG     
3 - Compare between the decrypted data and expected decrypted data

AES algorithm routines can return AUTHENTICATION_SUCCESSFUL in case of successful 
Decryption operations or one of the following error codes in case of fail:
 
  - AES_ERR_BAD_OPERATION,
  - AES_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT,
  - AES_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER.
  - AUTHENTICATION_FAILED
