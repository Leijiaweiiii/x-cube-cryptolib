@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library RSA encryption/decryption 
algorithm and the different steps to perform RSA Encryption/Decryption processes.

This example is split into two parts:
The first part is to: 
1 - Encrypt DATA with RSA  

RSA encryption algorithm routines can return RSA_SUCCESS in case of successful encryption 
operations or one of the following error codes in case of fail:
 
  - RSA_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER,
  - RSA_ERR_MESSAGE_TOO_LONG,
  - RSA_ERR_BAD_OPERATION.

The second part is to:
1 - Decrypt DATA in with RSA
2 - Compare between the decrypted data and expected decrypted data

RSA decryption algorithm routines can return RSA_SUCCESS in case of successful encryption 
operations or RSA_ERR_GENERIC  in case of fail.
