@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library AES algorithm
and the different steps (Initialization/Append data/Finalization) to perform AES
256 bits Encryption/Decryption processes for XTS mode.

This example is split into two parts:
The first part is to:
1 - Encrypt DATA in XTS mode 
2 - Compare between the encrypted data and expected encrypted data 

AES algorithm routines can return AES_SUCCESS in case of successful encryption 
operations or one of the following error codes in case of fail:

  - AES_ERR_BAD_OPERATION
  - AES_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT
  - AES_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER
  - AES_ERR_BAD_INPUT_SIZE 

The second part is to:
1 - Decrypt DATA in XTS mode
2 - Compare between the decrypted data and expected decrypted data 

AES algorithm routines can return AES_SUCCESS in case of successful decryption 
operations or one of the following error codes in case of fail:

  - AES_ERR_BAD_OPERATION
  - AES_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT
  - AES_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER
  - AES_ERR_BAD_INPUT_SIZE.  

  IEEE vectors examples for XTS are taken from:
	"IEEE P1619™/D16 Standard for Cryptographic Protection of Data on 
	 Block-Oriented Storage Devices "
